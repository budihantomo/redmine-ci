Redmine-CI is a PHP clone of the popular Ruby on Rails web-based project management tool Redmine (http://redmine.org).

The project is mainly started to provide a solid project management tool based on Redmine, accessible to those who don't have Rails hosting. This means it will run on pretty much any webhosting which have at least PHP and MySQL available.

The project uses the CodeIgniter framework by EllisLab, Inc (http://codeigniter.com).
